### `Get-AltaCompiler` Script
This little PowerShell Core script provides a function with the same name to easily download the Alta compiler for any supported system.

Its intended usage is in Continuous Integration (CI) builds (a.k.a. build servers) for projects written in Alta, but it can be used in general just to get a portable copy of the Alta compiler.
